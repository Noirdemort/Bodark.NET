# Bodark.NET
C# based password generator, manager and encryptor, to be used just below application layer of software.

Major issues:-
  - Find a replacement for sodium library
  - Check licenses of used packages for conversion from MIT License to GPLv3.
  - Add or write double ratchet protocol (Axolotl algorithm), message signing and key signing in PrivacyUtils
  - Find or write implementation of Zero knowledge proof, deniable auth
  - write proof of concept homomorphic encryption
  - Provide double ratchet interface for email [probably separate project]
  
Project documentation, testing pending.
